# UniverseNet

UniverseNet is the state-of-the-art detector that can be trained in 24 epochs.

![COCO AP](docs/imgs/coco_ap_time_epoch.png)

UniverseNet+GFL (Res2Net-101) is further accurate (**val AP: 50.8**).

Concepts:
1. Universal scale detection
2. Universal training settings (standard hyperparameters)
3. Universal Background Model (base model to be transferred)

## Introduction

MMDetection is an open source object detection toolbox based on PyTorch. It is
a part of the OpenMMLab project developed by [Multimedia Laboratory, CUHK](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/).

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.3 to 1.6**.
The old v1.x branch works with PyTorch 1.1 to 1.4, but v2.0 is strongly recommended for faster speed, higher performance, better design and more friendly usage.

### Major features

- **Modular Design**

  We decompose the detection framework into different components and one can easily construct a customized object detection framework by combining different modules.

- **Support of multiple frameworks out of box**

  The toolbox directly supports popular and contemporary detection frameworks, *e.g.* Faster RCNN, Mask RCNN, RetinaNet, etc.

- **High efficiency**

  All basic bbox and mask operations run on GPUs. The training speed is faster than or comparable to other codebases, including [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2), [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark) and [SimpleDet](https://github.com/TuSimple/simpledet).

- **State of the art**

  The toolbox stems from the codebase developed by the *MMDet* team, who won [COCO Detection Challenge](http://cocodataset.org/#detection-leaderboard) in 2018, and we keep pushing it forward.

Apart from MMDetection, we also released a library [mmcv](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv) for computer vision research, which is heavily depended on by this toolbox.
